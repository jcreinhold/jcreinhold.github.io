I thought that my course notes for real analysis were pretty lackluster, but were
still useful for me to write and have for reference. Over the summer I took a
class in algorithm design and analysis. This time
I included worked examples as well as the major topics covered. I'll probably try
to continue to do this for some of my courses next semester, since this seems to
be an effective way to organize notes and maintain a copy of notes that doesn't get lost.
The overview probably contains (many) typos.
