Recently, I gave a presentation for a class on using active contours for image segmentation.
I specifically focused on the [Chan-Vese](http://www.math.ucla.edu/~lvese/PAPERS/IEEEIP2001.pdf) algorithm,
but also introduced edge-based methods as well.

Below are the slides and a jupyter notebook containings some experiments with the
[skimage](https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/auto_examples/segmentation/plot_chan_vese.html) implementation
of the algorithms.
