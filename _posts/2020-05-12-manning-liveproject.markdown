Recently, I published a course on medical image analysis with PyTorch with Manning. 
The course focuses on the image synthesis/image translation task, but it should give
a reasonable overview to working with structural 3D medical images, especially with
respect to deep learning and PyTorch. [Here](https://www.manning.com/liveproject/3d-medical-image-analysis-with-pytorch?a_aid=reinhold&a_bid=a334582c) 
is a link to the course.
